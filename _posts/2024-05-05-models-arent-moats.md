Every founder tells investors their secret sauce is "proprietary models." Six months later that model is on HuggingFace.

### Three moats that survived 2024

1. **Distribution loops** – my Bolt referral tree still prints installs years later.  
2. **Unique data exhaust** – CloudSale.ai's email reply corpus retrained scoring every night.  
3. **Workflow lock-in** – when your agent lives in the CRM sidebar, ripping it out hurts.

### Checklist before bragging about your moat

- Can a junior engineer replicate it this weekend?  
- Does it improve daily with usage?  
- Does churn spike if you disable the browser extension?

If the answer is no, ship faster and talk less.
