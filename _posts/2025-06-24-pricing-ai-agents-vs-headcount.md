Start-ups keep slapping "$49 / month" on their agent products because that's what every SaaS-land icon did in 2012. Problem: an agent that replaces half a sales-rep's day is worth more than Notion—and costs a lot more to run.

### The two axes that matter

1. **Outcome captured** – hours saved or revenue generated per user.  
2. **Marginal inference cost** – GPU time, data calls, external APIs.

Plot your agent on that plane; the quadrant tells you the pricing model:

| Quadrant | Outcome | Cost | Pricing pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | High | High | Usage or revenue-share (e.g., 2 % of pipeline) |
| 2 | High | Low | Seat-based + implementation fee |
| 3 | Low | High | Don't ship—pivot or bundle |
| 4 | Low | Low | Classic SaaS tiering |

CloudSale.ai lived in Q1 early on—we charged **per qualified meeting** because GPU cost per prospect was non-trivial. Six optimisations later we crossed the diagonal; now a hybrid seat fee made sense.

**Rule of thumb:** price to match how Finance already sees the problem. If they compare you to staffing cost, charge like headcount; if they budget you under "infrastructure," look at usage buckets.
