A single prompt can 10× an AI feature's value. Product managers underestimate this because prompts feel like copy, not code.

### My favourite prompt skeleton

```
You are a {{role}}.
Goal: {{business_metric}}.
Context: {{facts}}.
When unsure, ask follow-up questions.
Return JSON: {schema}
```

At YAYAR Tech we swapped a 300-word ramble for that template and cut hallucinations from 18 % to 4 %. Investors thought we'd shipped a new model.

### Why prompts scale value faster than features

* **Zero deploy friction** – change text, ship.  
* **Transferable IP** – template works across industries.  
* **Compounding logs** – every run is training data.

The next unicorn will look boring in Git diff—just a few lines of text ensuring the AI talks money, not magic.
