Remember MySpace profile themes? Garish colours, autoplay music—pure self-expression. Then Facebook put everyone in the same blue hoodie.

Today AI is pulling us back toward the MySpace ethos—except this time your dashboard **writes itself around your workflow**.

### Why now

* **Zero-config LLMs** convert a paragraph of instructions into working CRUD code.  
* Hosting costs ⬇ so shipping ten micro-apps costs the same as one monolith.  
* Users are burned out on generic SaaS (“another Slack plugin?”) and crave tools that feel bespoke.

At _CloudSale.ai_ we let every BDR tweak the lead-scoring agent with a personal playbook. Result: 17 % lift in reply rate without a single engineering ticket.

### Playbook for indie builders

1. **Start with a narrow pain**—e.g., “merge my five finance exports into one report.”  
2. Let the user *describe* their dream UI; render with code-gen.  
3. Store edits as JSON patches so each account forks gracefully.  
4. Price on outcome (see my June '25 post) so heavy personalisation doesn't kill margin.

The takeaway: in 2009 the slogan was "There's an app for that." In 2025 it's "There's *my* app for that."
