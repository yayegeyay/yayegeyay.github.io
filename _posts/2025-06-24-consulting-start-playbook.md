People keep DM-ing me: "How did you go from operator to five-figure consulting invoices in 90 days?" Here is the ultra-compressed playbook.

### 1. Outcome positioning > Hourly rates

Pick a *pain metric* you can move (cost per lead, model latency, infra bill). Charge a % of the delta, not hours.

### 2. Three-page site beats 30-page deck

Home · Services · About. 400-word copy each. Real numbers, one CTA to a scheduling form. I built mine in a weekend with Jekyll.

### 3. Anchor case studies fast

Do one cheap project for an ex-colleague. Get a quote plus metric: "30 % cost saved in 4 weeks." Splash that front and centre.

### 4. Advisory retainer ≈ personal runway

Two clients at $19.5 k/mo each pay for a lean team and your AWS bill. Scope: weekly call, async feedback, zero ad-hoc coding.

### 5. Pipeline flywheel

Write one short essay every week (see this blog). Each post → 2-3 inbound leads → 1 call → 0.3 closed retainer.

Stick to the loop; adjust prices quarterly; enjoy the leverage.
