I get a lot of DMs from talented operators and engineers who see the AI gold rush and want to stake a claim. They ask, "How did you go from a full-time CTO role to signing five-figure consulting invoices in less than 90 days?" It wasn't magic. It was a repeatable playbook.

This is the compressed version of that playbook. It's for anyone who has real, hands-on experience and wants to turn it into a leveraged, independent career.

### 1. Position on Outcomes, Not Hours

The biggest mistake new consultants make is selling their time. No one cares how many hours you work. They care about the results you deliver. Instead of quoting an hourly rate, anchor your services to a specific, painful business metric you can demonstrably move.

*   **Bad:** "I offer AI engineering services for $200/hour."
*   **Good:** "I build AI agents that reduce lead qualification time by 80%. I charge a percentage of the pipeline value generated."

Pick a metric (cost per lead, model latency, infrastructure spend, user churn) and build your entire practice around it. This changes the conversation from "How much do you cost?" to "How much value can you create?"

### 2. A Three-Page Website Beats a Thirty-Page Deck

Your website is not a novel. It's a billboard. It needs to convey your value proposition in under ten seconds. All you need are three simple pages: Home, Services, and About.

*   **Home:** A one-sentence value prop, a few logos of past clients/employers, and a clear call-to-action.
*   **Services:** A list of 2-3 packaged offerings with clear deliverables and starting prices.
*   **About:** A brief bio that establishes credibility and explains why you're qualified to solve the client's problem.

I built the first version of my own site in a single weekend using Jekyll. It was simple, direct, and focused on one thing: getting qualified prospects to book a call through a scheduling form.

### 3. Anchor Your Credibility with a Quick Win

You need social proof, and you need it fast. The easiest way to get it is to do a small, heavily discounted project for a former colleague or a friendly contact in your network. Your goal is not to make money; it's to get a testimonial and a hard metric.

A quote like, "Ege's system reduced our data processing costs by 30% in just four weeks," is worth more than any sales deck. Splash that quote and metric on the front page of your site. It becomes the anchor for all future client conversations.

### 4. Use an Advisory Retainer as Your Runway

The holy grail of consulting is recurring revenue. An advisory retainer is the fastest way to get there. Find two companies that need ongoing strategic guidance but don't need a full-time executive. Offer them a package that includes one weekly strategy call and unlimited asynchronous feedback (via Slack or email) for a flat monthly fee.

The scope is critical: you are selling your brain, not your hands. Make it clear that ad-hoc coding is out of scope. Two clients at a modest $19.5k/month each provides a stable runway of nearly $40k/month. That's enough to pay your bills, hire a virtual assistant, and invest in your own business.

### 5. Build a Pipeline Flywheel

Your expertise is your best marketing tool. The most sustainable way to generate inbound leads is to give away your knowledge for free.

Here's the flywheel that has consistently worked for me:

1.  **Write one short, insightful essay every week.** (See the rest of this blog for examples).
2.  **Share it on LinkedIn and Twitter.**
3.  **Each post generates 2-3 inbound leads** from founders and executives who see their own problems in your writing.
4.  **Each lead results in a discovery call.**
5.  **For every three calls, you close one new client.**

This isn't a "get rich quick" scheme. It's a system. Stick to the loop, adjust your prices quarterly as demand increases, and enjoy the leverage that comes from being a recognized expert in your niche.
