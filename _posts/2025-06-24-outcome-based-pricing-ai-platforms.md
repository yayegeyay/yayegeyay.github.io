Most AI–tool vendors still copy the SaaS playbook: charge a flat fee per month and hope your usage costs stay below it. That model breaks when your users are *agents* rather than humans—and when half of them are weekend hackers shipping experiments that might spike to 10 × traffic overnight.

In my last venture, **CloudSale.ai**, we watched GPT costs swing 30 % week-to-week. A predictable subscription from our infra provider would have felt nice, but what actually mattered was aligning incentives: they should win *when we win*.

### Why outcome-based beats credit-based

1. **Risk symmetry** – If the platform takes a 5 % rev-share, it's suddenly motivated to help you optimise prompts, cache embeddings, and renegotiate LLM pricing.
2. **Fewer early-stage barriers** – Indie builders can launch without a $500 platform bill hanging overhead.
3. **Built-in success services** – Need to migrate from Supabase to Postgres? The vendor now has economic reason to handle it for you.

### A practical framework

| Stage | Platform cut | Services unlocked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <$10 k ARR | 0 % | Self-serve templates |
| $10 k–$100 k | 5 % | Chat support, scaling guides |
| $100 k+ | 15 % | White-glove infra tuning, dedicated TAM |

The takeaway: price like a *silent co-founder*, not a landlord. The next generation of AI platforms will live or die by how much real revenue they create for "vibe coders" who'd rather ship than monitor Stripe webhooks.

*Have thoughts? I'm running experiments with outcome-based billing on two client projects—drop me a note if you're curious.*
