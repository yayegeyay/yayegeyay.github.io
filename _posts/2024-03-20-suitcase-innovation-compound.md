The first wheeled suitcase was invented in 1970. It was a brilliant, obvious innovation. But it took another *twenty-five years* for someone to add two more wheels and create the four-wheeled spinner we all use today.

This isn't a story about slow inventors. It's a lesson in how innovation actually works. It's rarely a single "eureka" moment; it's almost always a series of compounding, often unglamorous, improvements built on a stable foundation. The final, transformative product is just the last piece to click into place.

In the AI world, we're living through a hundred different suitcase moments at once. The core technologies aren't always new, but the enabling conditions are.

*   **GPU clouds** have been available for over a decade, but it took the viral accessibility of ChatGPT to make mass-market GPU utilization an obvious business strategy.
*   **Vector databases** existed in academia and niche applications for years, but the rise of open-source embedding models made them a critical, urgent piece of the modern tech stack.

I learned this lesson the hard way during my time as a partner at MEGVII, the computer vision unicorn. We had developed a state-of-the-art model for detecting manufacturing defects. In the lab, it was flawless. But in the real world, it was a two-wheeled suitcase—functional, but clunky and awkward to use. Our clients, who ran factories in five different countries, couldn't justify the cost of the high-end industrial cameras required to feed our model the pristine data it needed.

The model was brilliant, but the ecosystem wasn't ready. For two years, adoption was slow. Then, a breakthrough happened—not in our labs, but in the supply chain. A new generation of high-resolution, low-cost ($10) camera sensors hit the market. Suddenly, our "expensive" AI solution became a no-brainer. Adoption spiked. We weren't selling a different model, but the world around it had changed. The final caster had clicked into place.

Founders and product leaders are often obsessed with finding the next monumental breakthrough. But the biggest opportunities usually lie in connecting existing, proven technologies in a new way, or waiting for the one missing component that makes the whole system viable. Sometimes, you don't need to invent a new form of travel; you just need to add two more wheels.
