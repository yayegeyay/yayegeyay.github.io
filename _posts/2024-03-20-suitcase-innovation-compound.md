The first wheeled suitcase hit market in 1970. It took *25 more years* for someone to say: what if … four wheels?

Innovation = baseline tech × timing × distribution. Same in AI.

* GPU clouds existed a decade ago; ChatGPT made them obvious.  
* Vector DBs were around; open embeddings made them urgent.

As a PM at MEGVII I learned the hard way: a brilliant CV model without cheap cameras was a three-wheel suitcase—it moved, but badly. Once $10 hi-res sensors arrived, adoption spiked.

Lesson: sometimes you don't need new science, just one missing caster.
