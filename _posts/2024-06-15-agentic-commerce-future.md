Malls → websites → apps → **agents**. The next commerce wave isn't where we shop but *who* shops on our behalf.

At Bolt I watched cash-on-delivery culture resist e-commerce until mobile wallets made checkout one tap. Agents drop taps to zero.

### Anatomy of a shopping agent

1. **Preference graph** – colours I wear, sizes that fit, brands I boycott.  
2. **Budget guard-rails** – monthly spend, max per item.  
3. **Deal crawler** – browserless APIs scraping promo codes faster than interns.

Hook that to a card with programmatic limits and the agent can't overspend.

### Early KPI signals

* 27 % of CloudSale.ai users already let an agent buy enrichment credits automatically.  
* A pilot with a DTC apparel brand saw 8 % higher AOV when the agent negotiated bundles.

### Builder opportunities

* **Trust layer** – human-readable diff of cart before purchase.  
* **Returns arbitration** – agents that handle RMA flows end-to-end.  
* **Brand matchmaking** – getting into the agent's "preferred vendor" list becomes the new SEO.

Commerce always follows friction. Agents erase the last manual step—expect wallets to get very busy while we sleep.
