I was raised in Istanbul, a city where cultures and continents come together. My family’s background is defined by perseverance: one grandfather drove a taxi, the other served as a police officer, and my grandmothers grew up without the opportunity to learn to read or write.

Yet through sheer perseverance, my parents, an engineer and a banker, carved out successful professional careers. Their journey from modest roots to achievement has profoundly shaped my worldview and instilled in me an unwavering drive to create impact through innovation.

Inspired by the determination and ambition my parents instilled in me, I began pushing my own boundaries early on. At just 13, I spent countless late nights in my room learning to code, eventually launching an e learning website that attracted thousands of visitors. That drive opened unexpected doors: it led me to connect with Markus Villig, Europe's youngest self made billionaire, and by 16, I was working directly with him at Bolt for nearly two years. 

Working side by side with Markus as a teenager, I saw up close how bold vision and relentless execution turn scrappy startups into global powerhouses (Bolt.eu, now valued at over $10B, is a service I use with pride, whether traveling in Cape Town or living in my current home, Toronto).

These years shaped my journey a lot and I am still enjoying working with great people, great companies and adding more value to the world with technology and experimentation. Here's my boring version of my CV for you to check further:
