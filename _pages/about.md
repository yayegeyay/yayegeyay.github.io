## From Istanbul to AI Entrepreneurship

I was born and raised in Istanbul, where I earned a full scholarship to one of Turkey's top science high schools. It was there, in a computer lab with old CRT monitors, that I wrote my first neural network. That experience sparked a lifelong passion for applied mathematics, which led me to McGill University on a Hugh M. Brock Scholarship. At McGill, I specialized in AI, spending my nights in the MILA lab and my days building the hackathon projects that would eventually land me my first seed check.

After graduating, I embarked on a journey that took me through founder, product, and market expansion roles on three different continents. I scaled Bolt's ride-hailing service in Turkey, shipped complex computer vision products for MEGVII in Asia, and co-founded CloudSale.ai in Canada. Each of these experiences, from setting quarterly pipeline targets with a sales team to debugging a GPU memory leak with an engineering team, taught me a single, crucial lesson: **great AI is useless until it reliably serves a business need.**

Today, I use that lesson to help other companies. I work with leadership teams to map their business processes, identify the highest-impact opportunities for AI, and implement systems that create real, measurable value. My goal is to embed this capability in an organization, so their first AI win is the first of many.
