## From Istanbul to AI Entrepreneurship

Born and raised in Istanbul, I earned a full academic scholarship to one of Turkey's top science high schools, where I wrote my first neural-net in a computer-lab that still ran CRT monitors. A passion for applied math took me to **McGill University** on the Hugh M. Brock Scholarship. There I specialised in artificial intelligence—spending nights in the MILA lab, days building hack-weekend projects that landed my first seed cheque.

After graduating I rotated through founder, product, and expansion roles across three continents—scaling Bolt's ride-hailing launch in Turkey, shipping computer-vision products at MEGVII, and eventually co-founding CloudSale.ai in Canada. Each stop taught me the same lesson: great AI is useless until it runs reliably in production.

Today I help engineering teams embed that lesson—so their first model in prod isn't their last.
