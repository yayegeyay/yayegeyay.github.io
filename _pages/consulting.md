## From Process Chaos to AI-Powered Efficiency

Your team is great at what they do. But their workflows are a tangle of manual steps, SaaS tools that don't talk to each other, and missed opportunities. You know AI can help, but you're facing a hundred vendors promising magic and a tired engineering team with no time for science projects.

I bridge that gap. I don't just recommend tools; I deliver a **repeatable system** for operational excellence, blending process mapping with targeted AI solutions.

## My Consulting Philosophy: Capability, Not Dependency

My goal isn't to make you reliant on me. It's to install a new capability within your organization. We'll work together to build a culture of continuous, AI-assisted improvement. When our engagement ends, your team will have:

*   **A Clear Process Map:** A visual blueprint of your core business workflows, identifying every friction point and opportunity for automation.
*   **A Vetted AI Toolkit:** Instead of endless demos, you get a short-list of 2-3 vetted AI startups perfectly suited to your specific problem, along with a plan for a low-cost pilot.
*   **An In-House Playbook:** A simple, repeatable guide for your own engineers to identify future bottlenecks and implement their own AI-powered solutions, ensuring the improvements continue long after I'm gone.

## How I Work: A Phased Approach

1.  **Process & Systems Audit (2 Weeks):** We sit with your sales, marketing, and operations teams to map your current state. We identify the top 3 bottlenecks where AI can deliver the fastest, highest-ROI wins.
2.  **Solution Vetting & Pilot (4-6 Weeks):** I tap into my network of AI startups to find the right tools for the job. We design and run a small, low-risk pilot with one of them to prove the value and get your team comfortable.
3.  **Playbook & Enablement (Ongoing):** I document the pilot's success and create a playbook from it. This becomes the first chapter in your company's new guide to leveraging AI for operational efficiency, which we can continue to build together.

## Representative Results

> "Ege didn't just give us a tool; he gave us a new way of seeing our own sales funnel. The agent playbook he built lets one BDR do the work of three."  
> — VP Growth, Series-B SaaS

> "We were drowning in AI hype. Ege cut through the noise, found a startup that solved our churn-prediction problem in a month, and saved us a six-figure engineering headache."  
> — Founder, FinTech SMB

> "Our engineers are brilliant, but they don't think in terms of business process. Ege's playbooks became the translator we desperately needed."  
> — Head of Engineering, Logistics Startup

## Is This For You?

This model works best for growth-stage SMBs ($5M-$100M ARR) that have product-market fit but are struggling with operational scale. If you feel like you're leaving money on the table due to inefficient processes, let's talk.
