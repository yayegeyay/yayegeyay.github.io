## From Process Chaos to AI-Powered Efficiency

Your team is great at what they do. But their workflows are a tangle of manual steps, SaaS tools that don't talk to each other, and missed opportunities. You know AI can help, but you're facing a hundred vendors promising magic and a tired engineering team with no time for science projects.

I bridge that gap. I don't just recommend tools; I deliver a **repeatable system** for operational excellence, blending process mapping with targeted AI solutions.

## My Approach: A System for AI-Driven Growth

I don't sell AI tools or bill by the hour. I deliver a repeatable system for finding and fixing inefficient processes using the right blend of AI solutions and human expertise.

### 1. The AI Opportunity Roadmap (2-Week Diagnostic)
We start with a rapid, intensive deep-dive into your core business processes. I'll work alongside your sales, marketing, and ops teams to map your current workflows, identify hidden friction, and pinpoint the top 3-5 areas where AI can deliver the highest ROI. You get more than a report; you get a strategic playbook with a clear ROI model and a shortlist of vetted AI startups ready for a pilot.

### 2. The AI Pilot Program (4-6 Week Implementation)
With a clear target from the roadmap, we move from strategy to execution. I'll manage a focused pilot program, implementing a targeted AI solution (from my network of vetted startups or built bespoke) with a small user group. We'll measure everything against baseline KPIs, prove the value, and build a powerful internal case study you can take to your board to secure buy-in for a full-scale rollout.

### 3. The In-House Enablement System (Quarterly Retainer)
My ultimate goal is to make your own team self-sufficient. This ongoing partnership focuses on building a permanent AI capability within your organization. I'll train your team to manage the new AI tools, interpret performance data, and—most importantly—run the diagnostic playbook themselves to continuously find new opportunities for improvement. It's about creating a culture of AI-driven efficiency that lasts.

## What Makes This Different

*   **Founder-Level Perspective:** I've been a CTO and a CRO. I understand the trade-offs between engineering constraints and revenue targets, and I know how to build solutions that satisfy both.
*   **Vetted Startup Network:** You don't have time for endless sales demos. I maintain a curated network of best-in-class AI startups, so I can match you with the right tool for your specific problem, fast.
*   **Focus on Capability, Not Dependency:** I don't want to be a permanent line item on your budget. My work is done when your team has the skills, tools, and playbooks to continue improving on their own.
