## Unlock Revenue with Human-AI Sales Systems

Your engineering team builds features; your sales team books meetings. The gap? A repeatable process that lets the two reinforce each other. I design **human-AI workflows** where Business Development Reps partner with purpose-built agents that mine leads, craft outreach, and surface next-best actions—no extra head-count required.

Think of me as the bridge between CRO priorities and ML-engineer constraints: I map the funnel, translate it into data requirements, then deliver lightweight agent tooling your reps actually use.

## I'm not a consultant who optimises for recurring revenue

You shouldn't have to hand over 12-month retainers or buy "maintenance" hours that create perverse incentives. My goal is to **install repeatable AI-engineering processes** inside your company so you own the expertise after I'm gone.

When we wrap, your team will have:

* Continuous evaluation & feedback loops for every model in prod
* 3-5× faster experimentation cycles (from weeks to days)
* A data-driven roadmap that targets the highest-impact AI bets
