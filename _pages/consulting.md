## Transform your great engineers into great AI engineers

Your existing engineering team can ship robust AI in weeks—not quarters—when they have the right processes, templates, and guard-rails. I work side-by-side with your developers, transfer my playbooks, and leave you with permanent in-house capability instead of a never-ending consulting retainer.

**You get independence, not dependencies.**

## I'm not a consultant who optimises for recurring revenue

You shouldn't have to hand over 12-month retainers or buy "maintenance" hours that create perverse incentives. My goal is to **install repeatable AI-engineering processes** inside your company so you own the expertise after I'm gone.

When we wrap, your team will have:

* Continuous evaluation & feedback loops for every model in prod
* 3-5× faster experimentation cycles (from weeks to days)
* A data-driven roadmap that targets the highest-impact AI bets
