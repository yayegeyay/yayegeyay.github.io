# 💥 What's up?

I'm an independent AI consultant, serial entrepreneur, and startup advisor with 10+ years building AI systems that actually work in production. I've founded and scaled 4 companies, including CloudSale.ai which achieved 7-figure ARR through AI agent automation.

After building AI products that served 500+ enterprise clients and scaled across 5 countries, I now help teams work more systematically—measuring AI performance, iterating quickly, and focusing on what truly delivers business value.

I've helped dozens of teams transition from traditional software to AI-first approaches. When I'm not consulting, I produce educational content and courses to help more engineers systematically improve their AI applications.

I'm also the Co-Founder & CTO of **CloudSale.ai**, where we built AI agents for B2B sales automation, achieving 3x outbound efficiency improvements and scaling to 100+ enterprise clients with 40% month-over-month revenue growth.

## Independent Consulting

I run a solo consulting practice focused on helping teams systematically improve AI applications and build production-grade systems that deliver measurable business impact.
