# 💥 What's up?

I'm a founder-turned-advisor who blends board-level business strategy with hands-on AI execution. After scaling **CloudSale.ai** to seven-figure ARR—tripling outbound efficiency with agent-powered prospecting—I now help leadership teams turn ambitious AI ideas into *predictable revenue* and sustainable margins.

I've sat on both sides of the table: setting quarterly pipeline targets with CROs and debugging GPU bill spikes with engineers. That mix lets me translate between OKRs and JSON logs—and ensures every model I ship moves a finance metric, not just a latency chart.

I've helped Fortune 500s cut costs with computer-vision roll-outs, guided scale-ups through their first LLM deployments, and advised startups all the way from seed round to sustainable growth.
