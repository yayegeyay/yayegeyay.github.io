# 💥 What's up?

I'm a founder-turned-advisor who has spent over a decade building and scaling AI-powered companies. After leading teams that shipped products generating over **$50M in ARR**, expanded into **5 countries**, and achieved **7-figure revenue in under a year**, I now help other leaders turn their ambitious AI goals into predictable business outcomes.

I've sat on both sides of the table: setting quarterly pipeline targets with CROs and debugging GPU memory leaks with engineers. This dual perspective allows me to bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution, ensuring that every AI initiative is tied to a measurable financial result.
