# 💥 What's up?

I'm a serial entrepreneur, AI executive, and academic consultant with 10+ years building technology ventures. I've founded and scaled 4 companies, including industry-first AI products serving 500+ enterprise clients.

After building successful AI startups valued at $8B+, I now teach teams to work more scientifically—measuring improvements, iterating quickly, and focusing on what truly matters in AI implementation.

I've helped dozens of teams transition from traditional software to AI-first approaches. When I'm not consulting, I teach independent consultancy at University of Toronto and produce educational content to help more entrepreneurs thrive in the AI landscape.
