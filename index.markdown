# 💥 What's up?

I'm an independent AI consultant and serial entrepreneur who has spent the last decade turning AI prototypes into production systems that scale. Most recently, I co-founded CloudSale.ai, where our AI agents boosted B2B outbound efficiency 3× and helped the company reach seven-figure ARR in under a year. Today I work with product and engineering teams to ship reliable, revenue-generating AI—fast.

I've helped Fortune 500s cut costs with computer-vision roll-outs, guided scale-ups through their first LLM deployments, and advised startups all the way from seed round to sustainable growth.
